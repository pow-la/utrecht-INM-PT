# Utrecht: Integrated Network Management (INM)
This repository contains the code which was produced during the Master Thesis of Paula Vogg at TU Delft. The project is an extension for public transport of an existing traffic control logic called Integrated Network Management (INM). For the Master Thesis an extensive data analysis with public transport data and system data was performed. ¨
The data analysis is structured in three levels of detail (macro, meso, micro).
